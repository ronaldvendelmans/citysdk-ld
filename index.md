# Endpoint Amsterdam
**_adding scalability to real-time open data_**

This webservice offers unified and direct access to open data from government, commercial and crowd sources alike. This open interface is adopted as standard by 6 European cities in the Project CitySDK.

A list of available data in this endpoint can be seen via [data]({{ site.baseurl }}/data) and the [map viewer]({{ site.baseurl }}/map).

## Project CitySDK

CitySDK is creating a toolkit for the development of digital services within cities. With open and interoperable digital service interfaces, CitySDK enables a more efficient utilisation of the expertise and know-how of developer communities. 

See the [Project Website](http://www.citysdk.eu/) for a comprehensive overview of the complete CitySDK toolkit.
