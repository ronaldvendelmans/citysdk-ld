# API key / account

##Read

No API key is needed to read data from this API, see our [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq) as well. 
 
##Write

To create your own layer of data, link it to objects/data and more you can get an account by sending an email atcitysdk@waag.org. We aim to reply within two business days.
All Write API requests require authentication by means of a session key, a random string that provides temporary, secure access to the Write API. See the wiki at our GitHub repository: [github.com/waagsociety/citysdk-ld](https://github.com/waagsociety/citysdk-ld]).
