# Data & other APIs

##### What is the CitySDK Linked Data API?

The CitySDK Linked Data API is a linked data distribution platform. See the [about page](about) for more information.

##### What's the difference between CitySDK LD API and other data catalogs and platforms (e.g. CKAN, Socrata)?

The main difference is that CitySDK LD API creates links between objects in different datasets from different data sources. CitySDK LD API stores data about objects that really exist in a city - e.g. bus stops, bridges, roads, neighborhoods and museums - and collects and links these datasets and APIs; available via one simple interface for both realtime and static data. See the [about page](about), [API specifiation](dev) or the examples in the [map viewer](map) for more information.

CitySDK is more than a data catalog. Data is stored in CitySDK itself, making it searchable, comparable and viewable.

##### Which datasets are available in CitySDK LD API?

The CitySDK [CMS](http://cms.citysdk.waag.org/) lists all datasets, with a data example in JSON and our map viewer.

##### Can you add dataset X?

Yes, probably. Datasets need to be open and have a geolocation. You can send an email to <a href='&#109;&#97;&#105;lto&#58;%63%69%&#55;4&#37;&#55;&#57;sd&#37;6&#66;%&#52;0wa&#97;&#103;&#46;org'>CitySDK Support</a> to request the addition of a dataset. You can also ask for a CitySDK account and add the dataset yourself using our CMS or API. 

##### How does CitySDK manage the differences in data models between European cities?

CitySDK does not aim to create new standards. In using the platform, it is likely that new users will look to (emerging) standards that are currently in use.

##### How does CitySDK manage the quality of datasets?

It doesn't. In CitySDK, the quality of datasets is very visible, which should provoke quality management by the data owners themselves. CitySDK shows the source, owner and license of each dataset.

##### Does CitySDK comply with existing standards/standardization practices (INSPIRE/W3C/Forum Standaardisatie/...)?

Yes, although the level of compliance varies between domains and datasets. 

##### Isn't building your own database a bit web 2.0?

CitySDK is not a database, it is a linked data distribution platform. CitySDK needs to store some parts of some datasets to make the data searchable, comparable and viewable. CitySDK stores static data, caches realtime APIs, provides a catalog of available datasets and links these together; all via one simple interface.

#####  Is their a link with PDOK?

[PDOK](https://www.pdok.nl/) is a Dutch national distribution service for geospatial datasets, run exclusively by government and not (yet) directed at European interoperability. PDOK offers standardized access to various governmental datasets, all in different layers, but without creating links between those layers.

##### How does CitySDK scale?

CitySDK is a distributed system where each data owner (such as cities, provinces or countries) can run its own instance.

##### Who are the intended users of CitySDK?

CitySDK is a powerful tool for any organisation wanting to distribute open data in a useful and attractive format, so that easy re-use and feedback on data is possible. This can be helpful for governments or city councils. Who is responsible for which part of open data distribution depends on individual cases and policies.

##### Who maintains CitySDK?

[Waag Society](http://waag.org) is running this instance of CitySDK.

##### What are the costs of CitySDK?

This depends on what you need. A minimum version would consist of costs for a server, bandwidth and support to keep the API running and give some assistance when importing datasets. 

##### What are the revenues of CitySDK?

This also depends on the individual use case. When sharing datasets between departments in your organisation, quick efficiency wins are possible. When you want to interest developers in working with your data, it is important to offer a comprehensive set of related data.
