#FAQ

## What is the CitySDK Linked Data API?

It is a web service offering unified and direct access to open data from government, commercial and crowd sources alike. The web service is a standard adopted by 6 European cities.

## What does the CitySDK Linked Data API do?
The Linked Data API makes data applicable in five steps. It:
1. collects data or web services from a myriad of sources
2. it describes the data
3. it links the data to reference datasets (e.g. from Cadastre or OSM)
4. offers the data as a unified service to other applications (API)
5. Allows those applications to annotate and enrich the data (incl. w/ open 311)
Independent from file format, refresh rate or granularity open data is easily accessible for commercial use, research and software developers. Thanks to the unique, open design the API can be linked to all national and  international systems and is interoperable with European standards.

## Which datasets are available in CitySDK?

The CitySDK [CMS](http://cms.citysdk.waag.org/) lists all datasets, with a data example in JSON and our map viewer.

## Can you add dataset X?

Yes, probably. Datasets need to be open and have a geolocation. You can send an email to <a href='citysdk@waag.org'>CitySDK Support</a> to request the addition of a dataset. You can also ask for a CitySDK account and add the dataset yourself using our CMS or API.

## Who maintains CitySDK?

[Waag Society](http://waag.org) is running this instance of CitySDK.
