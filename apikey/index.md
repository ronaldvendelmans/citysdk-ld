# API key / account

##Read

No API key is needed to read data from this API, see our [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq) as well. 
 
##Write

To create your own layer of data, link your data to objects/other data and more you will need an account. To get one send us an [email](mailto:citysdk@waag.org). We aim to reply within two business days.

All Write API requests require authentication by means of a session key, a random string that provides temporary, secure access to the Write API. See the wiki at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/waagsociety/citysdk-ld]).
