## Getting Started

The best tool to get a grip on the available open data is the List of datasets<link> combined with the Map Viewer<link>.

- Each datasets in the List of Datasets has a link tot he map viewer which gives you an instant view of datapoints in JSON with a corresponding Map View
- The query field on the Map Viewer also has a drop down menu with a number of example queries. 
 
## Developer Documentation API
This website contains endpoint specific information only, mainly regarding the datasets available here. Alle general documentation on the API can be found on the wiki at the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/waagsociety/citysdk-ld).
 
To get started there’s a Swagger implementation available here: <link>.
