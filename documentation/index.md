#Documentation

This unified REST API gives access to data from different sources available on a per-object basis. The JSON and RDF API is written in Ruby + Sinatra. Data is stored in PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. Documentation and source code can all be found on GitHub and thereâ€™s also a Ruby API gem.

**This website contains endpoint specific information only**, mainly regarding the datasets available here. Alle general documentation on the API can be found on the wiki at the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/waagsociety/citysdk-ld).
 
To help you get started a Swagger implementation will be available soon.

## Datasets in this endpoint
The [List of datasets]({{ site.baseurl }}/data) combined with the [Map Viewer]({{ site.baseurl }}/data) is the best tool to get a grip on the available open data:

- Each dataset in the List of Datasets has a link to the map viewer called **Show sample...** which gives you an instant view of datapoints in JSON with a corresponding view of points, lines or shapes on the map;
- The query field on the Map Viewer has a drop down menu as well with a number of example queries.

## Discovery API
There is a project wide [Discovery API](http://cat.citysdk.eu/) to see which City SDK API's are available for which geography/jurisdiction.
